# PCA One

PCA One - Short for **Padaroms Computer Architecture _Type 1_** - is an open source 16-bit computer architecture I'm developing. It includes auxiliary software, such as an assembler and a loader for its own instruction set.

### Specification
- Fixed-length instruction set (RISC)
- 16 bit word length

### How this project came to be
I've always been fascinated with digital electronics and computers. As a programmer for almost a decade I've been telling computers what they're supposed to do, but didn't know how they did it in detail. 

Intrigued by how those machines actually work on a hardware level I found the book "But How Do It Know" by J Clark Scott, which provides an excellent introduction into how computers work. Two years after reading the book I stumbled across some of Ben Eater's videos and realized that although it's an incredibly comprehensive topic it's not all that hard to get started with.

So I looked up a list of all components Ben used in his 8-bit computer series and bought all of them with a bunch of spare ones.

While building my clock module - it was Ben's video on that which made me realize I wanted to build a computer myself - I thought that even though it's nice to have a self-built 8-bit computer, it can't do terribly much. After some consideration I decided on building a 16-bit computer instead.
